# Linkedlist_DS
Practice problems

1. Detect and Remove loop in a Linked list :- If the loop is present in linked list remove that loop.

2. Remove Duplicate in sorted linked list

3. Add2List:- Add two numbers represented by linked lists
     
 Explanation: For the given two linkedlist (4 5) and (3 4 5), after adding the two linked list resultant linkedlist will be (3 9 0).

4. Intersection of two sorted Linked lists
  Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create a new list representing the intersection of the two lists.

5. Split circular list:- Program to split a circular linked list into two halves.

6. SuminDDL:- Find pairs with given sum in doubly linked list:- 
      Input : head : 1 <-> 2 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 8 <-> 9
        x = 7
      Output: (6, 1), (5,2)
      
7.  TripletSUMinDDL:- Count triplets in a sorted doubly linked list whose sum is equal to a given value x

8. RotateDDLbyN:- Rotate doubly Linked list by N nodes
